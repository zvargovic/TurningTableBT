# üì∏ ESP32-Based Turning Table for 3D Scanning

This project is a compact, gear-driven rotating table designed for 3D scanning, object photography, or automated product turntable use. The device is controlled via Bluetooth using a custom Android app, and supports configurable rotation direction, speed, and mode (one full turn or continuous).
