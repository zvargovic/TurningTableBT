## üß† Notes

- The stepper motor used is **28BYJ-48** with **ULN2003 driver**.
- The display is **SSD1306 128x64 I2C**, handled via the **U8g2** library.
- EEPROM stores:
    - Rotation mode: `C` (Continuous) or `T` (1 full turn)
    - Direction: `CW` or `CCW`
    - Speed: from `1.0` to `5.0` RPM (float)
- Gear ratio: `63.68 / 17.0` ‚Üí ‚âà **15340 steps** per platform rotation.
- OLED animation:
    - Speed varies with `targetRPM`
    - Direction matches `CW` or `CCW`
- SelfTest shows icons, popups, and tests rotation with different speeds/directions.
- Commands are received via **Bluetooth SPP** from the Android app.
